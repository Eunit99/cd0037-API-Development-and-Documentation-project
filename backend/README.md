# Trivia API

## Introduction

Trivia API was created as a backend for the Trivia project based on Udacity course, it has endpoints to handle creation of questions and also returning random question for quizzes. Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out, hence the creation of this trivia API.

All backend code follows the [PEP8 guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

- **BASE URL**: the base url is still at localhost since its still in local development

  ```curl
  localhost:5000/
  ```

- API KEYS / AUTHENTICATION: Authentication, authorization and API keys are not needed to access the API.

## Error

This project handles errors and success by using the traditional http response codes

1. ``2xx`` This code indicates successful responses
2. ``4xx`` This code indicates errors from client
3. ``5xx`` This code indicates errors from the server

Below are the list of the codes returned and their meaning

- ``200``: This code indicates that the request was successful sample.
- ``400``: This error occurs when the server will not process the request due to missing headers or data
- ``404``: This error is returned when the question, category or route requested was not found
- ``405``: This code indicates an error with this code occurs when the method used in the request was not accepted.
- ``406``: This error happens when a request is rejected due to missing or incorrect parameters.
- ``500``: This error indicates that the server could not handle the request
